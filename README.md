**How it works:** An ActiveX Object/Control is used to execute and show JavaScript that make a SVG using the library [D3](https://d3js.org/d3.v4.js).

**You will need:** The two source files (_SVGraph.ahk_, _SVGraph.html_) and the library [D3](https://d3js.org/d3.v4.js) in the same folder, IE11 and maybe the newest ahk version.

**Documentation:** See the [Wiki](https://github.com/CapnOdin/SVGraph/wiki).
